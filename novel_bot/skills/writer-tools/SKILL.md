# Writer Tools

This skill equips you with structured templates and methods for professional novel writing.

## Character Development

When asked to create or flesh out a character, use this template (adapt as needed):

```markdown
# [Name]
- **Role**: [Protagonist/Antagonist/Support]
- **Archetype**: [e.g. The Reluctant Hero]
- **Goal**: [What do they want?]
- **Motivation**: [Why do they want it?]
- **Conflict**: [What stands in their way?]
- **Flaw**: [Internal weakness]
- **Voice/Mannerisms**: [How they speak/act]
- **Backstory**: [Brief summary]
```

## Outlining (Save the Cat / 3-Act)

If asked for an outline, consider the **Save the Cat** beat sheet or standard 3-Act Structure:

1. **Act 1: The Status Quo & Inciting Incident**
   - Setup: Who are they?
   - Inciting Incident: The problem starts.
   - Debate: Refusal of the call.
   - Break into Two: They leave their comfort zone.

2. **Act 2: The New World**
   - Fun and Games: Exploring the new world/situation.
   - Midpoint: False victory or false defeat. Stakes raise.
   - All Hope is Lost: Rock bottom.

3. **Act 3: The Resolution**
   - Finale: The final battle/confrontation.
   - Final Image: How have they changed?

## World Building

Use the **GRAPES** method (or similar) if creating a new setting:
- **G**eography: Layout, climate, resources.
- **R**eligion/Beliefs: Gods, myths, values.
- **A**chievements: Art, tech, magic level.
- **P**olitics: Government, laws, power structure.
- **E**conomics: Trade, currency, wealth distribution.
- **S**ocial Structure: Classes, family, roles.

## Handling "Brainstorm" or "Plot Twist"

1. **Ask 'What if?'**: Invert a common trope.
2. **Chandler's Law**: "When in doubt, have a man come through the door with a gun." (Introduce immediate conflict).
3. **The 'No, and...' / 'Yes, but...'**:
   - Do they succeed?
   - "No, and things get worse."
   - "Yes, but there is a cost."

## Workflow

1. Discuss ideas with the user.
2. Create/update files in the workspace (e.g., `CHARACTERS.md`, `WORLD.md`).
3. **Always** check `memory/` for existing facts before contradicting them.
