# Chapter Writer Skill

This skill provides techniques and guidelines for writing individual chapters with professional craft. Use when the user asks to "write chapter X", "revise this scene", or improve prose quality.

## When to Use

- Writing a new chapter from outline
- Revising existing chapter content
- User complains about "flat" or "boring" writing
- Need to adjust pacing or emotional impact
- Balancing description, dialogue, and action

## Pre-Writing: Chapter Analysis

Before writing, analyze:

1. **Chapter Purpose**: What must this chapter accomplish?
   - Advance main plot
   - Develop subplot
   - Reveal character
   - Build world
   - Change emotional tone

2. **Outline Reference**: Check `OUTLINE.md` for:
   - Target chapter length
   - POV character
   - Key events to include
   - Subplot threads to touch

3. **Previous Context**: Read last 1-2 chapters for:
   - What just happened
   - Emotional state of characters
   - Unresolved tensions

## The Scene-Sequel Cycle

Structure chapters using alternating Scene and Sequel:

### Scene (Action)
**Goal → Conflict → Disaster**
- Character wants something specific
- Opposition prevents immediate success
- Ends with setback or complication

**Proportion**: 60-70% of chapter word count

### Sequel (Reaction)
**Reaction → Dilemma → Decision**
- Emotional response to what happened
- Review options and consequences
- Choose new goal (leading to next scene)

**Proportion**: 30-40% of chapter word count

## Prose Control Techniques

### 1. Description Management

**The 3-Sense Rule**: Every scene should evoke at least 3 senses:
- Visual (always)
- Plus two from: sound, smell, touch, taste

**Selective Detail**: Don't describe everything. Focus on:
- What's unusual or noteworthy
- What reveals character (what they notice)
- What advances mood or theme
- What will matter later (Chekhov's gun)

**Dynamic Description**: Avoid static lists. Embed description in action:
```
Weak: The room was dusty. There was a table. The table was old.
Strong: She brushed dust from the ancient table, her fingers catching on splintered edges.
```

### 2. Dialogue Craft

**Purposeful Speech**: Every line should do ONE of:
- Advance plot (reveal information)
- Reveal character (show personality)
- Create conflict (disagreement, tension)
- Build relationship (show dynamics)

**Dialogue Tags**: Use "said" 90% of the time. Other tags (whispered, shouted) for emphasis only.

**Action Beats**: Break dialogue with action to:
- Show emotion without naming it
- Control pacing
- Identify speaker without tags

```
"I won't do it." She slammed her fist on the table. "Not today, not ever."
```

**Subtext**: What characters DON'T say matters. Use:
- Evasion and deflection
- Interrupted thoughts
- Changed subjects
- Lies and omissions

### 3. Internal Monologue

**Stream of Consciousness**: For intense moments, show raw thoughts:
```
No. No no no. This wasn't happening. Not now, not after everything.
```

**Analytical Thought**: For strategic moments, show reasoning:
```
If she went left, she'd face the guards. Right meant the window—three stories up. Neither option ended well.
```

**Emotional Processing**: Show feelings through physical reaction:
```
Her stomach twisted. The room felt too small, the air too thin.
```

### 4. Pacing Control

**Fast Pacing** (Action scenes):
- Short sentences
- Paragraphs of 1-3 lines
- Minimal description
- Rapid dialogue exchanges
- Sentence fragments for impact

**Slow Pacing** (Emotional/Contemplative scenes):
- Longer, complex sentences
- Expanded paragraphs
- Rich sensory detail
- Extended internal monologue
- Metaphor and reflection

**Rhythm Variation**: Alternate between fast and slow within a chapter to prevent monotony.

## Narrative Techniques

### Show vs. Tell

**Show** (immersive, slower):
- Character actions and reactions
- Sensory details
- Dialogue and subtext
- Specific examples

**Tell** (efficient, faster):
- Time transitions ("Three days later...")
- Background information
- Summarizing unimportant events
- Establishing routine

**Rule**: Show the important, tell the mundane.

### Deep POV

Get inside the character's head:

**Filter Words to Minimize**: seemed, felt, thought, wondered, realized, noticed, saw, heard

**Instead of**: She felt angry.
**Write**: Her hands shook. She wanted to break something.

**Instead of**: He realized she was lying.
**Write**: Her eyes darted to the door. The story didn't add up.

### Opening Hooks

Start chapters with:
- **Action**: Something happening immediately
- **Dialogue**: Mid-conversation (intriguing)
- **Thought**: Character's pressing concern
- **Setting**: Unique or atmospheric location

Avoid: Waking up, looking in mirror, weather descriptions (unless exceptional).

### Ending Hooks

End chapters with:
- **Cliffhanger**: Immediate danger or surprise
- **Revelation**: New information that changes everything
- **Decision**: Character commits to risky course
- **Emotional Shift**: Relationship changes
- **Question**: Unresolved tension

## Chapter Structure Template

```
[HOOK - First paragraph grabs attention]

[SCENE - Character pursues goal]
- Establish where/when immediately
- Show goal through action, not exposition
- Introduce opposition/conflict
- Escalate complications
- End with setback or partial victory

[TRANSITION - Brief pause, process what happened]

[SEQUEL - Character reacts and decides]
- Emotional reaction (brief)
- Analytical review of situation
- Consider options
- Make decision (sets up next scene or chapter)

[HOOK - End with forward momentum]
```

## Revision Checklist

After drafting, verify:

- [ ] Word count matches target (±10%)
- [ ] POV remains consistent throughout
- [ ] Every scene has clear goal and outcome
- [ ] Dialogue sounds natural when read aloud
- [ ] No info-dumps longer than 2 paragraphs
- [ ] Sensory details present (3+ senses)
- [ ] Chapter ends with forward momentum
- [ ] No filter words unless intentional
- [ ] Action beats used instead of dialogue tags where appropriate
- [ ] Subtext present in important conversations

## Common Problems & Solutions

**Problem**: Chapter feels flat
**Solution**: Add micro-tension. Every interaction should have some friction, even between allies.

**Problem**: Too much exposition
**Solution**: Convert exposition to dialogue or action. Show discovery instead of explaining.

**Problem**: Pacing drags
**Solution**: Cut description by 50%. Start scenes later, end earlier. Remove transitional summaries.

**Problem**: Characters sound alike
**Solution**: Give each character distinct vocabulary, sentence length, and speech patterns.

**Problem**: Emotional distance
**Solution**: Use deep POV. Show physical reactions. Replace "she felt" with visceral details.

## Workflow

1. **Review Context**: Read previous chapters and outline
2. **Set Targets**: Confirm length and key events
3. **Draft**: Write following scene-sequel structure
4. **Self-Edit**: Run through revision checklist
5. **Deliver**: Present to user for feedback
6. **Revise**: Incorporate user input

## Quality Standards

Professional chapter writing should:
- Engage from the first sentence
- Maintain consistent voice and tone
- Balance all narrative elements (action, dialogue, thought)
- Advance at least one plot or subplot
- Deepen reader understanding of character
- Leave reader wanting to continue
```
