# Master Chapter Writing Skill

This skill guides the creation of novel chapters with elevated literary quality, emphasizing atmospheric construction, rhetorical artistry, and narrative depth—transcending mundane dialogue-heavy prose.

## Core Writing Principles

### 1. Description Over Dialogue

**Golden Ratio**: Description 60% : Dialogue 25% : Internal Monologue 15%

- Use environmental description to evoke emotion, not direct statements
- Use action details to reveal character, not explicit narration
- Use sensory experience to convey information, not dry exposition

### 2. Five-Sense Immersion

Every significant scene must activate at least three senses:

- **Visual**: Light, shadow, color, form, motion
- **Auditory**: Voices, ambient sounds, the resonance of silence
- **Olfactory**: Scents, odors, stale or fresh air
- **Tactile**: Temperature, texture, pain or pleasure
- **Gustatory**: Bitterness, sweetness, metallic taste, blood

**Example**:
```
Mediocre: The room was dark, and he was afraid.

Elevated: Twilight seeped through the gaps in the window lattice, weaving a gray net across the blue-brick floor. The air carried the musty scent of aged wood, and each breath felt like swallowing some viscous liquid. His fingertips touched the wall—cold, damp, like the skin of some living creature.
```

### 3. Rhetorical Artistry

#### Metaphor and Symbolism
- Concretize abstract emotions: "Loneliness is a city without walls"
- Map natural phenomena to inner states: "The downpour mirrored the turmoil in her heart"

#### Synesthesia
- "His voice carried the roughness of sandpaper"
- "That shade of red screamed across his vision"

#### Parallelism and Climax
- "He walked through spring's blossoms, summer's storms, autumn's falling leaves, winter's frost"

#### Subtlety and Implication
- Instead of "He was very sad," write "He gazed out the window, for a very long time"

### 4. Scene Construction: Three Elements

#### Spatial Layers
- Distant view: Sky, mountains, rivers, city silhouettes
- Middle ground: Buildings, streets, crowds
- Close-up: Characters, objects, textural details

#### Temporal Flow
- Dawn's mist, midday's heat, dusk's desolation, midnight's silence
- Seasonal transitions and their chromatic shifts

#### Atmosphere Crafting
- Tension: Short sentences, fragmented senses, rapid actions
- Serenity: Long sentences, delicate observations, slow pacing
- Mystery: Shadows, unknown sounds, unresolved details

### 5. Character Portrayal Techniques

#### Features Over Full Description
- Instead of "He was handsome," write "His brow bone cast a sharp shadow"

#### Action Reveals Character
- The anxious: Frequently adjusting clothing, unconsciously tapping surfaces
- The confident: Slow, steady gait, direct eye contact
- The timid: Averted gaze, hunched shoulders

#### Externalizing Inner Worlds
- Mirror emotions through environment: "Oppressive clouds" for depression, "Sunlight breaking through" for hope
- Convey feelings through physical reactions: Stomach tightening, throat drying, fingertips trembling

### 6. Narrative Pacing Control

#### Fast Pace (Combat, Chase, Crisis)
- Short sentences, verbs at the forefront
- Fragmented senses, simulating chaos
- Omit transitions, cut directly

**Example**:
```
A flash of steel.
Blood.
He twisted, feeling the blade's chill graze his ribs.
No time to breathe. The second strike came.
```

#### Slow Pace (Contemplation, Emotion, Description)
- Extended sentences, rich modifiers
- Delicate senses, layered complexity
- Stretched time, magnified details

**Example**:
```
The setting sun slanted through the west window, gilding her silhouette with golden light. Dust motes drifted slowly in the beam, like countless tiny worlds rotating in silent stillness. She watched that light, remembering an afternoon many years ago—the same radiance, the same silence, only then, her mother was still beside her.
```

### 7. Eastern Aesthetic Imagery

#### The Beauty of Emptiness (留白)
- Do not say everything; let the reader imagine
- End with scenery, leaving lingering resonance

#### Interplay of Void and Substance
- Substantial: Concrete object descriptions
- Void: Interwoven memories, imagination, dreams

#### Dynamic Stillness
- Motion highlighting stillness: "Cicadas' noise makes the forest quieter; birds' songs make the mountains more serene"
- Stillness highlighting motion: A single sound in complete silence

#### Color Symbolism
- Cyan (青): Vitality, hope, youth
- White (白): Purity, emptiness, death
- Red (红): Passion, blood, celebration
- Black (黑): Mystery, oppression, unknown
- Gold (金): Nobility, glory, illusion

## Writing Workflow

### Phase 1: Scene Conception
1. Determine the core emotion of the scene
2. Select dominant senses (visual/auditory/tactile)
3. Design 3-5 key images
4. Plan lighting and color palette

### Phase 2: First Draft
1. Open with environmental description to establish atmosphere
2. Introduce characters through distinctive details
3. Keep dialogue minimal; every line must carry weight
4. Intersperse internal monologue to deepen emotion

### Phase 3: Literary Polishing
1. Check five-sense coverage (at least three)
2. Replace direct statements with metaphor and implication
3. Adjust sentence length to control rhythm
4. Add Eastern aesthetic imagery elements

### Phase 4: Word Count Control
- If under count: Expand environmental description, deepen psychological portrayal
- If over count: Trim dialogue, remove repetitive narration

## Quality Checklist

- [ ] Every paragraph contains sensory details (at least one non-visual)
- [ ] No more than three consecutive lines of dialogue
- [ ] Character appearance conveyed through feature points, not full description
- [ ] Emotions implied through environment/action, not directly stated
- [ ] At least one rhetorical device employed (metaphor/synesthesia/parallelism)
- [ ] Scene has clear lighting/color palette
- [ ] Ending has lingering resonance, not abrupt
- [ ] Meets target word count (±10%)

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

**Pitfall 1: Dialogue Stacking**
- Problem: Characters talk endlessly, like a stage play
- Fix: Insert action or psychological description after each dialogue segment

**Pitfall 2: Omniscient Narration**
- Problem: "He was angry" "She felt sad"
- Fix: "His knuckles whitened with tension" "Her eyes burned, yet she lifted her chin stubbornly"

**Pitfall 3: Empty Scenery**
- Problem: Characters converse in a void
- Fix: Establish clear spatial awareness; let the reader know where they are

**Pitfall 4: Monotonous Pacing**
- Problem: Same speed throughout
- Fix: Alternate tension and relaxation, ebb and flow

**Pitfall 5: Lack of Distinctive Style**
- Problem: Reads like any other novel
- Fix: Establish unique imagery systems and linguistic rhythm

## Output Requirements

1. **MUST use write_file tool to save chapters**, do not output full text directly
2. Self-check word count before saving
3. Call memorize_chapter_event to record key plot points after saving
4. Confirm successful save to user, briefly summarize chapter highlights
